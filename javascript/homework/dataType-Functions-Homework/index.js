/* 
## The Recipe Card
Never forget another recipe!

- Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
- On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:
    - Mole
    - Serves: 2
    - Ingredients:
    - cinnamon
    - cumin
    - cocoa

*/

/* 
## The Reading List
Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

- Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'

/* 
## Your top choices
- Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
- For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."

Write a function named greaterNum that:
- takes 2 arguments, both numbers.

## The World Translator
Write a function named helloWorld that:
- takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
- returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for atleast 3 languages. It should default to returning English.
- Call that function for each of the supported languages and log the result to make sure it works.

## The Pluralizer
Write a function named pluralize that:
- takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.

/* 
## The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Write a function named tellFortune that:
- takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

/* 
## The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

- Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
  - takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
  - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
    outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
- Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

/* 
## The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

- Write a function named calculateSupply that:
  - takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
  - calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
  - outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
- Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
- Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
*/



/* 
## The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

Create a function called calcArea:

- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

## The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
